# Implement MPP Payment Discovery

Publish an OpenAPI document with MPP payment discovery metadata so AI agents
can discover your payable endpoints via the
[Machine Payment Protocol](https://mpp.dev)
([spec](https://paymentauth.org/draft-payment-discovery-00.txt)).

## Requirements

- Serve `/openapi.json` at the site root with HTTP 200
- Include `x-payment-info` extensions on payable operations
- Each `x-payment-info` must declare `intent` (charge or session), `method` (tempo, stripe, lightning, card), and `amount`
- Optionally include `currency`, `description`, and top-level `x-service-info` with categories

## Validate

```
POST https://isitagentready.com/api/scan
Content-Type: application/json

{"url": "https://YOUR-SITE.com"}
```

Check that `checks.commerce.mpp.status` is `"pass"`.
